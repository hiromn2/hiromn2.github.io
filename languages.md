I share personal impressions from when I used to teach Japanese in Brazil. You should receive it as a paternalistic advice from someone that is interested about the topic but be free to criticize me! No, actually, please tell me any insight you have. I love this topic.

This is the fundamental formula of language level.

$$Level = \alpha Brain_usage $$

Where $\alpha$ represents all the uncontrolable effects (for instance, your age, your proximity to the target language, your talents). Those affect the speed of your acquisition but are not relevant since you cannot control anyway. Besides one's objective for learning is never tied to comparison with its peers. One should not give up if it is not the first-placed in its Japanese classroom.

On the other hand, Brain usage is hard. It means that two people could be watching Netflix in their target language and nevertheless one is super focused on decoding the complex structure of spoken language and the other just work on their ability of reading subtitles. 

For sure, some passive assimilation is helpful but in much less degree if your mind is not engaged with it. The only thing that matters for learning a language is hard work. You can be very smart about how to do this hard work though. 

1. Take classes that are slightly above your level
2. Transmission of the information is always more important than the grammar
3. Learn some grammar structures first and deploy them a lot! It is hugely useful to build confidence with familiar sentence structures that are powerful enough and use them for most of your conversations until you reach greater proficiency
