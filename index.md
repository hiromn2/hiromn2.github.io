## Description

Hi! My name is Mateus Hiro Nagata. A first-principles thinker Data Scientist/Economist. My interests revolve around transforming ML and data science analysis into actions using solid economic theory. Specifically, I can translate data-driven analysis into human-interpretable insights. 

Currently, I devised new Machine Learning and Reinforcement Learning algorithms and applied them to Game Theory (the analysis of strategic interaction between agents) and Decision Theory (the analysis of individual decision). Those got recognition at 

My experiences include 4 papers published into top journals using Time-Series Analysis in Finance (and Extreme-Value Theory) and Machine Learning analysis and Predictions.  

## Research Projects

### Algorithmic Game Theory x Reinforcement Learning

Nash equilibrium (NE), a fundamental concept in strategic interaction presupposes a difficult epistemic condition: common knowledge of rationality and of payoff (or utility) functions. However, utility is not observable in cardinal terms. Moreover, NE pressuposes an entity that recommends a strategy for both players. But if no such entity exists, how can people arrive at a stable outcome? From a player's perspective, one may never feel assured to be playing a Nash equilibrium due to ignorance of the opponent's payoff.

The learning perspective in Game Theory adresses the gap. Algorithms like Experienced-Weighted Attraction and (stateless) Q-learning model suboptimal agents that iteratively refine their strategy to improve performance. Currently, I am investigating the behavior of these algorithms in relation to correlated equilibrium and the effect of noise in the payoffs.

### Decision Theory x Statistical Learning

Just as how human cognition inspired the creation of neural networks, I appreciate the elegance of using statistical techniques to understand the human mind - and vice versa.

Recently, my work has been about using Case-Based Decision Theory and VC-dimension to voting. The central question is: Can in-sample knowledge alone determine the best (presidential) candidate in terms of populational preferences? If so, can we establish meaningful bounds for the potential error in terms of dataset size and number of candidates? Another question I am dealing with is the estimation of utility and probability weighting functions in risky decision making using a Neural Network hereby circumventing traditional parametric assumptions.
