## Description

Hello! My name is Mateus Hiro Nagata. A first-principles data scientist and economist. I am particularly interested in using learning theory (statistical learning, machine learning, reinforcement learning) to understand game theory and decision theory. Those have direct implications in how companies might price and compete against each other, or how to negotiate in high-stakes scenarios. 

My capabilities can be seen by the development of new techniques ML techniques and RL techniques that I have developed to bridge Economics and Data-driven approaches. So, my results are not only accurate and powerful, but also interpretable for the human mind.

In the past I have also worked with Time-series in Finance (using Extreme-value Theory).

## Research Projects

### Algorithmic Game Theory x Reinforcement Learning

Nash equilibrium (NE), a fundamental concept in strategic interaction presupposes a difficult epistemic condition: common knowledge of rationality and of payoff (or utility) functions. However, utility is not observable in cardinal terms. Moreover, NE pressuposes an entity that recommends a strategy for both players. But if no such entity exists, how can people arrive at a stable outcome? From a player's perspective, one may never feel assured to be playing a Nash equilibrium due to ignorance of the opponent's payoff.

The learning perspective in Game Theory adresses the gap. Algorithms like Experienced-Weighted Attraction and (stateless) Q-learning model suboptimal agents that iteratively refine their strategy to improve performance. Currently, I am investigating the behavior of these algorithms in relation to correlated equilibrium and the effect of noise in the payoffs.

### Decision Theory x Statistical Learning

Just as how human cognition inspired the creation of neural networks, I appreciate the elegance of using statistical techniques to understand the human mind - and vice versa.

Recently, my work has been about using Case-Based Decision Theory and VC-dimension to voting. The central question is: Can in-sample knowledge alone determine the best (presidential) candidate in terms of populational preferences? If so, can we establish meaningful bounds for the potential error in terms of dataset size and number of candidates? Another question I am dealing with is the estimation of utility and probability weighting functions in risky decision making using a Neural Network hereby circumventing traditional parametric assumptions.
